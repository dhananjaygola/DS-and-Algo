# Question

Given the heights of N towers and a value of K, Either increase or decrease the height of every tower by K (only once) where K > 0. After modifications, the task is to minimize the difference between the heights of the longest and the shortest tower and output its difference.

<br />
  
## Examples

- Input: arr[] = {1, 15, 10}, k = 6
- Output:  Maximum difference is 5.
- Explanation: Change 1 to 7, 15 to 9 and 10 to 4. Maximum difference is 5 (between 4 and 9). We canâ€™t get a lower difference.

<br />

- Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 15, 10}, k = 3   
- Output: Maximum difference is 8, arr[] = {4, 8, 12, 7}
